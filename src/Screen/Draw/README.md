# Drawing

Here are all components of my own drawing library for lilygo t5-45, it makes drawing much easier  
This library allows to create some basic components and place them inside parent components  

## TODO
- Make text properties update after changing text or font - Done
- Add updating all children after adding to component (actually parent is not updated, which is error prone) - Done, just use update on component
- (optional) add pixel filters for images
- (optional) add table adapters
